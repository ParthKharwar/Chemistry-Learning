# Chemistry-Learning
C++ implementation of basic first year of engineering Chemistry calculations.

This program performs the basic chemistry calculations required by first year engineering students of Mumbai University.
It calculates:
1. Gross Calorific Value
2. Net Calorific Value
3. Atom Economy
4. Acid Value
5. Saponification Value
6. Hardness of Water
7. Basic arithmetic values

This program also contains a hidden snake game. This game was build with it in mind that not every student studies all the time.

It is coded in C++ and runs in a Turbo C emulated in a DOS environment to perform complex graphical and arithmetic operations. 
It can be run in other environments that support the C++ graphics library as well.

It's learning functionality is present as the user can see the formula being used for each of the calculations and also verify their physical calculations.
